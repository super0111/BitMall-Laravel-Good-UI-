With this we advice that you keep your wallet details safe. Do not reveal your login details for any reason to anyone. Use only secure internet connections, use an anti-virus within a network that you don't trust. Be wary of any suspicious links to avoid clicking on phishing links.":"Your crypto wallet on Bitmall is safe. However, crypto-exchanges and wallets generally do not provide insurance and 100% security to be used to store money in the same way as a bank. Not surprisingly, as the value of a bitcoin has increased, so too has the number of viruses designed to steal bitcoin from wallets, as well as cyber attacks against exchanges. With this we advice that you keep your wallet details safe. Do not reveal your login details for any reason to anyone. Use only secure internet connections, use an anti-virus within a network that you don't trust. Be wary of any suspicious links to avoid clicking on phishing links.","Role created successfully with permissions":"Role created successfully with permissions","Staff added successfully":"Staff added successfully","Go Back":"Go Back","Edit Role Permissions : Test Role":"Edit Role Permissions : Test Role","Your two step authentication OTP is :":"Your two step authentication OTP is :","Please check your phone number to get OTP code.
